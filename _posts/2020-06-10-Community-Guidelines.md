StickerMobi Stickers, once indexed, can be seen by anybody using StickerMobi; therefore, it’s important to be mindful of the type of Stickers that are appropriate for the site. To do that, we’ve set up a few guidelines that we ask you follow. Thanks for helping us make StickerMobi a positive experience for everyone!

# StickerMobi Golden Rules:

Keep Stickers Friendly: The purpose of Stickers is to add a bit of fun to our online lives, so keep your Stickers friendly. Do not create or upload any Sticker meant to hurt another individual.

Respect Privacy: It’s important to respect and honor the privacy and consent of the individuals depicted in your Stickers. Make sure you’re authorized to use any video or images from the appropriate people before you use them to make a Sticker.

Credit the Community: People work hard to make their Stickers, and we want to make sure they get their proper dues. Help us support the community by using StickerMobi’s share tools to make sure that the original creator is getting credit for the work.

Sharing: Sharing is great. Please use StickerMobi's embed options, available on each Sticker's individual page, for proper sharing on your blog or social media accounts. Before you use Stickers you find on StickerMobi or anywhere else on the web, you'll want to make sure you're comfortable that your use complies with any laws applicable where you're located.

# Stickers that are not allowed on StickerMobi:

Pornography & Explicit Nudity: You can’t upload anything that depicts any form of sex act or other sexually explicit material. Straight up: Your Stickers can’t show any explicit nudity at all. Sorry! In general, if it’s not something that you’d show your mom, don’t upload or create it on StickerMobi.

**Violence:** We mind Violence Stickers, if it’s real, it’s not allowed. Any Stickers that portray real death, mutilation, gore, or assault are not permitted.

**Self-Harm:** You can’t create, upload, or share anything that encourages or promotes self-harm. This includes activities or behavior related to suicide, self-mutilation, or eating disorders.

**Animal Cruelty:** Absolutely no Stickers of animals being harmed or abused are permitted. Period.

**Bullying, Stalking, Harassment, or Threats:** You can’t create, upload, or share Stickers to bully, harass, or threaten another individual.

**Hate Speech:** Stickers are meant for everyone, so we don’t allow any that slander, demean, or belittle another group or person based upon their race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. Those are a definite no.

**Illegal Activity:** Don’t create, upload, or share Stickers of illegal activity on StickerMobi. You also can’t use StickerMobi to engage in or promote illegal activity.

**Private Information:** You can’t create, upload, or share Stickers that reveal any private or sensitive information about another person. This includes things such as addresses, phone numbers, passwords, and anything else that could be considered personal.

**Spam:** Making Stickers that advertise your businesses for your own marketing purposes is perfectly fine; however, you cannot use inaccurate tags to try to make your Stickers appear in search results that are not related to your business or promotion.

**DMCA:** If you’ve had your copyrighted material used to create a Sticker on StickerMobi without permission, please follow the DMCA guidelines.
